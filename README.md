# displays

## Overview
* This is using Arduino for building a quick prototype to create a display driver for the SSD1331.
* Since I am designing a generic display driver, I am implementing one for SSD1331 to get a good idea \
on approaching for a generic interface for display drivers.
* Going to be making a few drivers for STM32F4, and the Arduino boards.
* Developing display drivers to the SSD1331 and the


## Goal
* Developing SSD1331 Display for Arduino, and then will take a look into developing the display \
    foir STM32F429I-DISC
